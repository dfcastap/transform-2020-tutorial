    "Between January and the end of May, Victoria mined and stacked 2.4 million tonnes of ore grading 0.84 g/t gold and produced 25,068 oz. as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company has also made a US$7.1-million principal repayment on its secured credit facility at the end of May. The next principal and interest payment is due at the end of August; the company has the option to repay this debt early.\n",

    "Victoria wholly owns the 555-sq.-km Dublin Gulch property in central Yukon, which hosts the Eagle and Olive gold deposits.\n",

    "Proven and probable reserves across Eagle and Olive total 155 million tonnes grading 0.65 g/t gold for a total of 3.3 million oz. Cut-off grades for the reserves vary with deposit and material type and range from 0.15 g/t gold to 0.58 g/t gold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on a technical report released last December, the Eagle mine is expected to produce an average of over 210,000 oz. of gold a year at all-in sustaining costs of US$774 per oz. over a mine life in excess of 10 years.\"\"\""
