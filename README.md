**_Idea to MVP_ tutorial at TRANSFORM 2020**

This repo contains, or links to, everything you need to follow along with the tutorial.

I'll assume you have the `conda` package and environment manager. (If you don't have it, you can install it [from here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).)

## Create an environment

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate t20-fri-mvp
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name t20-fri-mvp

Now you're ready to use the notebooks and the app in this repo.
